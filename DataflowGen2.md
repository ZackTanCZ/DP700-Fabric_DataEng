# Dataflow Gen2
Dataflows Gen2 enable connection to the various data sources, and then prepare and transform the data. You can land the data directly into your lakehouse or use a data pipeline for other destinations (sink).

## Dataflow
* Dataflows are a type of cloud-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool for building and executing scalable data transformation processes
* Extract data from various sources, transform it using a wide range of transformation operations, and load it into a destination
* Uses Power Query Online also allows for a visual interface to perform these tasks

## Dataflow Use Cases
* Data Pipeline to copy data and use your preferred coding language to ETL the data.
* Else, use Dataflow to extract and transform the data first, then load it into another endpoint
* Combine both approaches -> a Pipeline to extract and load the data into your preferred destination. A Dataflow Gen2 to connect to Lakehouse data to cleanse and transform data
